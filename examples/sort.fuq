# Sorting works by setting a few simple rules using the sortrule function
# The benefit of having a seperate function for this is that the join
# function can use these rules to insert while sorting

load("examples/table.csv", table)

sortrule(table, Salary, 0) # Sort by Salary in descending order

sort(table)

printt(filter(table, [INDEX] <= 10)) # Print first 10 becasue the table is a bit too big
